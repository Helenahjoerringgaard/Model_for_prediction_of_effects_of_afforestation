Numerical Model for Prediction of the Effect of Afforestation in Gistrup, Denmark

This model predicts nitrate concentrations throughout the limestone layer at an afforestation site in Gistrup, Northern Jutland, Denmark. Also, the model predicts groundwater recharge and nitrate leaching. The model investigates three scenarios for the project location; continuing arable land, grass field or afforestation. Furthermore, afforestation is examined as either an coniferous or decidious forest. The model includes the growth of the forest until canopy closing after 20 years.
