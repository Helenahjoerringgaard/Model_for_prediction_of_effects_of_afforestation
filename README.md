Numerical Model for Prediction of the Effect of Afforestation in Gistrup, Denmark

This model predicts nitrate concentrations throughout the limestone layer at an afforestation site in Gistrup, Northern Jutland, Denmark. Also, the model predicts groundwater recharge and nitrate leaching. The model investigates three scenarios for the project location; continuing arable land, grass field or afforestation. Furthermore, afforestation is examined as either an coniferous or decidious forest. The model includes the growth of the forest until canopy closing after 20 years. 

All files needs to be downloaded, and the .mat files should be imported to Matlab before running the script. rain_input.mat is not necessary in order for the model to work, but it is recommened to import this array, and then skip running the two first sections of the script. 

Extrapolation of evapotranspiration is done in excel sheets, as is the calulation of leaf area index for a growing forest in the excel sheet "LAI".
"Nitratkoncentrationer" is the measured nitrate concentration at the project location.
